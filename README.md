# Airship

Airship theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/), based on [Vapor](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor).

## TODO

- [x] Navigation only, not slug, on non-home pages.
- [x] Use header wrap for borders.
- [x] Improved slug.
- [x] Add some color (links + header?).
- [x] Improve header styles on mobile.
- [ ] Typography pairings could be better, and limit number of font sizes. Three fonts + icon font is excessive.
- [ ] Underline gradients backwards in Firefox, and a bit funny in Safari.
